MLP stands for Multi-Layer Perceptron, which is a type of artificial neural network commonly used for supervised learning problems, such as classification and regression.

An MLP consists of multiple layers of interconnected artificial neurons, also known as perceptrons. Each layer is fully connected to the next, meaning that each neuron in a layer is connected to every neuron in the following layer. The first layer is called the input layer, which receives the input data, and the last layer is called the output layer, which produces the prediction. The layers in between are called hidden layers.

Each artificial neuron receives inputs from the previous layer, performs a weighted sum of the inputs, and applies a non-linear activation function to produce its output. The activation function is used to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships in the data. Common activation functions include the sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU functions.

The MLP is trained using a process called backpropagation, where the error in the prediction is propagated backwards through the network to update the weights of the neurons. This is done using gradient descent, where the weights are adjusted to minimize the error in the prediction.

MLPs can be used for both binary and multi-class classification problems, as well as for regression problems. They have been widely used for many applications, such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing
